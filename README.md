# EV Fleet Analytics - Full-Stack Developer Assessment

# How to start the project

## Local-Dev :

If you have tmux installed you can start the project using the provided `./start.sh`.

Else start manually :

```sh
docker compose up database redis -d
pnpm run dev:backend
pnpm run dev:frontend
```

You can test the prod config running docker compose :

```sh
docker compose up
```

> note: There could be some inconsistencies if you run manually the
> backend then through docker (or reverse) due to sync and migrations.
> If so just `docker compose down -v` and relaunch. I should have
> covered most of the cases so it shouldn't happen but i'm not used to
> the way typeorm handle migrations (i've used drizzle more but wanted
> to stay close to the provided task).

> note 2 : Also if the site does not display at all after running the full docker and switching back to dev verify your browser does not try to serve https instead of http for localhost (Firefox for exampel tends to do thaht a lot)

Now that you have started the project you could also have a glance at [my feedback](FEEDBACK-SIMON.md)

## Overview

Design and implement a small full-stack application to help fleet managers monitor their electric vehicle fleet's efficiency and environmental impact. This project should demonstrate your ability to create clean, well-organized code while solving real-world problems.

## Expected Solution

- We are looking forward to a project that keeps the provided organization, so please **do not split** your code into different projects
- We expect a solution that will run without us having to do any modifications or debugging, make sure that your project **works from scratch**
- The commands that are listed should be enough to launch the project and the seeder
- **Important**: Focus on code quality over feature quantity. It's okay to mock some data or functionalities, but document any assumptions you make.

## AI Usage Guidelines

While AI tools can be valuable learning resources, excessive reliance on AI-generated code for this assessment defeats its purpose and **will harm your candidacy**.
This test evaluates your problem-solving abilities, technical decision-making, and coding practices not how much code you can produce.

During the review process, be prepared for:

- A live discussion about your implementation
- Questions about specific technical choices
- Potential real-time modifications to your code

## Timeline & Submission

- **Duration**: 3 days
- **Expected effort**: 4-5 hours
- **Submission method: Private GitHub repository**
- **Share access in a private github repository with**:
    - https://github.com/antonin-beev
    - https://github.com/JadBeev
    - https://github.com/CarlEH

## Project Requirements

### 1. Backend (NestJS)

#### Data Model

The application will track vehicles with the following properties:

- ID (uuid)
- Brand (string)
- Model (string)
- Battery capacity (kWh)
- Current charge level (%)
- Status (enum: available, charging, in_use)
- Last updated (timestamp)
- Average energy consumption (kWh/100km)
- Type (BEV/ICE) - _BEV = Battery Electric Vehicle, ICE = Internal Combustion Engine_
- Emission*gco2_km - \_Grams of CO2 per kilometer*

**Data Source**: Seed your database using the provided `data/cars.csv` file (available in the project repository).

#### API Endpoints

1. **Vehicle Management**
    - GET /vehicles - List all vehicles with pagination and filtering
    - POST /vehicles - Add new vehicle
    - GET /vehicles/:id - Get vehicle details
    - PUT /vehicles/:id - Update vehicle
    - DELETE /vehicles/:id - Remove vehicle
2. **Analytics**
    - GET /analytics/fleet-efficiency
        - Average energy consumption rates across different models
        - Emissions comparison between BEV and ICE vehicles
    - GET /analytics/fleet-composition
        - Distribution of BEV vs. ICE vehicles
    - GET /analytics/fleet-operational
        - Current fleet availability rate (% of vehicles available)
        - Number of vehicles currently charging vs. in use

#### Technical Specifications

- Use [NestJs](https://docs.nestjs.com/) as the backend framework
- Use [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm) for database interactions
- Implement request validation using [class-validator](https://docs.nestjs.com/pipes#class-validator)
- Add Redis caching for analytics endpoints
- Include error handling middleware
- Write [unit tests](https://vitest.dev/) for services
- Add [e2e tests](https://playwright.dev/) for critical endpoints

### 2. Frontend (React)

#### Features

1. **Dashboard Overview**
    - Fleet summary statistics
    - Fleet status
    - Environmental impact metrics
2. **Vehicle Management**
    - List view with sorting and filtering
    - Add/Edit vehicle forms
3. **Bonus:** Analytics Visualization using analytics endpoints

#### Technical Specifications

- Use TypeScript
- Implement using [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) components
- Style with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs)
- Use [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) for data fetching
- Include unit tests for key components
- Implement error boundaries
- Add loading states

## Bonus Points

- Implemented monitoring/logging
- Advanced caching strategies
- Performance optimizations
- CI setup
- Additional features that add value

## Evaluation Criteria

We're looking for:

- Clean, maintainable code
- Problem-solving approach
- Attention to detail
- Learning ability
- Technical decision-making
- Time management

# Project Setup Guide

## Prerequisites

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Node.js 20+
- pnpm

## Service Ports Overview

| Service       | Internal Port | External Port | Access URL            | Description                   |

> **Note for Redis Insight**: Use the connection string `redis://default@redis:6379`

## Docker Commands

```bash
# Build all services
docker compose build

# Start all services
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker compose down
```

## Development Workflow

```bash
# Install all workspace dependencies
pnpm install

# How to run a command in a specific workspace
pnpm --filter backend YOUR_COMMAND
# Or
pnpm --filter frontend YOUR_COMMAND

# Start backend first
pnpm dev:backend

# Then start frontend
pnpm dev:frontend
```

## Troubleshooting

1. Ensure Docker is running
2. Verify pnpm and Docker versions
3. Use `docker-compose logs` to inspect service startup issues

## Notes

- Default credentials are set for development
- ALWAYS change credentials in production

## FAQ

1. **Q: Where can I find the cars.csv file?**
   A: The file will be available in the project repository under the `data` directory.
2. **Q: What if I can't complete all requirements in time?**
   A: Focus on code quality over quantity. Document what you would have done with more time.
